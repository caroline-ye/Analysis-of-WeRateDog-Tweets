    "# Analysis of WeRateDog Tweets\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "This project collected tweets information posted from Nov 15, 2015 to Aug 1, 2017 from a Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs, which is an account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. I cleaned and did some simple analysis on the data to gain some insights about the dog rating. A neural network was also used to predict the breed of the dog from the posted image.\n",

    "## Results\n",

    "Figure 1 showed that the counts of likes and retweets of tweets increased over time. The number of likes that each tweet has increased as a rate of 31 per day since the first tweet posted on Nov 15, 2015 (Figure 1a). The number of retweets that each tweet has increased as a rate of 6 per day since the first tweet (Figure 1b).\n",
