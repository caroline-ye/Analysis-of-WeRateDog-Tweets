    "# Wrangling Report for WeRateDog Twitter Data\n",
    "\n",
    "## Table of Content\n",
    "- [Part I - Gather](#gather)\n",
    "- [Part II - Access](#access)\n",
    "- [Part III - Clean](#clean)\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='gather'></a>\n",
    "## Part I - Gather\n",
    "1. Manually download `twitter-archive-enhanced.csv` file and upload to the same directory of `wrangle_act.ipynb`\n",
    "2. Download `image-predictions.tsv` file by `Requests` library\n",
    "3. Obtain the JSON file of each tweet in `twitter-archive-enhanced.csv` file using Twitter's API `tweepy` and save all to `tweet-json.txt` file.\n",
    "4. Extract *tweet_id*, *favorite_count*, *retweet_count* to `tweet-extended.csv` file\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='access'></a>\n",
    "## Part II - Access\n",
    "Access `twitter-archive-enhanced.csv`, `image-predictions.tsv`, `tweet-extended.csv` files and find out the following items to be fixed:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Quality issues:\n",
    "- `twitter-archive-enhanced.csv` table contains 181 retweets.\n",
    "- Some tweets are missing in `tweet-extended.csv` and `image-predictions.tsv` tables.\n",
    "- Columns related to retweets are not necessary in the table: *retweeted_status_id*, *retweeted_status_user_id*, *retweeted_status_timestamp*\n",
    "- Columns *in_reply_to_status_id*, *in_reply_to_user_id* are also irrelevant.\n",
    "- Timestamp should be in datetime format.\n",
    "- The denominator is not 10 for 23 rows.\n",
    "- Some rows contain very high or very low numerators.\n",
    "- Some rows may contain 2 different stages.\n",
    "- One more column in `image-predictions.tsv` table is needed to contain the prediction result for each tweet for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tidiness issues:\n",
    "- Doggo, floofer, pupper, and puppo should be in one categorical column\n",
    "- `tweet-extended.csv` and `twitter-archive-enhanced.csv` table should be combined because they describe one observation (tweet).\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='clean'></a>\n",
    "## Part III - Clean\n",
    "1. Remove the retweet by dropping rows with `retweet_status_id` value\n",
    "2. Some tweet_id are deleted when I downloaded the tweet JSON files and the `image-predictions.tsv` table doesn't contain prediction for each tweet. So getting the common rows from 3 tables are the best solution. Pandas `merge` function is used here.\n",
    "3. Drop the irrelevant columns: *retweeted_status_id*, *retweeted_status_user_id* and *retweeted_status_timestamp*, *in_reply_to_status_id* and *in_reply_to_user_id*\n",
    "4. Split the merged table to two tables: `tweet_clean` and `image_clean`. `tweet_clean` contains information about tweets, while `image_clean` contains information about prediction of images.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### For `tweet_clean` table\n",
    "5. Check if any tweet contains two dog stage information and drop them.\n",
    "6. Create a new column *none* for rows without stage information and convert *doggo*, *floofer*, *pupper*, *puppo*, *none* to one column *stage* and then set the column type to category\n",
    "7. Convert the *timestamp* column to datetime\n",
    "8. Investigate the 23 rows with non-10 denominator. Drop rows without rating information and set others' denominator to 10.\n",
    "9. check if the number before '/10' matches with numerator. If not, correct it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### For `image_clean` table\n",
    "The `image` table contains top 3 predictions of the picture given by neural network. I used the prediction result which is a dog breed and also has highest confidence as the result of prediction for each tweet and then catogery the tweets by the top 10 dog breeds, not_dog and other_dog.\n",
    "10. Delete the tweet_id which exist in `image_clean` table but not in `tweet_clean` table. \n",
    "11. Create a new column `prediction` and the value is the most likely prediction results which is a dog breed\n",
    "12. Create a new column `breed`, making the value the same as `prediction` value for top 10 dog breeds and not_dog and changing others to other_dog\n",
    "13. Change the `breed` column to category\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Final Cleanup\n",
    "14. Reset index for two tables and check if two tables contain the same tweet_id\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Storge\n",
    "15. Save two tables to two files `tweet_clean.csv` and `image_clean.csv`.\n",
    "16. Merge two tables and store it as one file `twitter_archive_master.csv`."
